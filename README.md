### Data

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) is a part of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and is the primary source of transportation data for the U.S. government. They collect, analyze, and disseminate data on all modes of transportation. This dataset, known as the “Airline On-Time Performance Data”, encompasses detailed records of scheduled and actual departure and arrival times for non-stop domestic flights reported by certified U.S. air carriers. 

Since June 2003, the airlines that report on-time data also report the causes of delays to BTS. This is available in a publicly accessible interface where users can explore various aviation databases, including the "Airline On-Time Performance Data," to retrieve specific datasets. The raw data can be downloaded in excel sheets, with the option to obtain one month of data at a time.
